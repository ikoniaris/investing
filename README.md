Hello world,

I started angel investing around the time I was hired by facebook, in 2009. I worked at fb until 2011; I left and have been investing, skydiving, traveling, and playing at burning man since.

I recently attended Y Combinator's AngelConf. My friend and former coworker, Paul Buchheit, was kind enough to share a detailed account of his angel investing history. Although, I doubt nearly as much can be gleaned from my experiences as a much more novice investor, in the spirit of openness and sharing, I wanted to start releasing a record of my experience.

In wanting to share some information about angel investing, GitHub seemed as natrual a place as any. I'll continue to share more as time and circumstances permit.

Please feel free to reach out with questions or comments.

Best,
John
